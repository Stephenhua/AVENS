# AVENS

**AVENS** (**A**erial **VE**hicle **N**etwork **S**imulator) is part of a research project that aims to provide a simulation test bed for virtual experiments of network coverage and connectivity among Unmaned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) flying in cooperation or sharing the same airspace. This is achieved by integrating LARISSA, X-Plane Flight Simulator and OMNeT++ Network Simulator.

At this moment, a [demonstration](https://github.com/lsecicmc/AVENS/tree/Demonstration) is available to download. It includes a Visual Studio and a OMNeT++ project that were used to create the bridge between simulators through an XML file. Arbitrary Mobility model for INET framework is also available.

Currently, the laboratory is working on bringing the code to the newer version of OMNeT++ and INET framework, as well as improving data exchange. A new version is planned to be released in Febuary 2017.
